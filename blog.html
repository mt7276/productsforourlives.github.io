                            <h5>First week with night vision</h5>
    
                            <p>
                                When I was younger I was always playing outside after dark in the neighborhood or the woods by my house. My friends and I would 
                                do anything to keep the daytime fun going, whether it was playing flashlight tag or just hiking around and hanging out. I remember 
                                always wanting night vision back then and thought it was the coolest thing ever when I would see it in magazines or catalogs. The 
                                thought of being able to see in the dark or how fast my team would win at flashlight tag seemed bigger than life in my young mind. 
                                The problem was, 30 years ago or so, when I was wanting night vision it was a lot more expensive than it is today and I couldn't 
                                afford it. If I remember correctly, the cheaper options started around $400 to $500 and went up from there.
                                <br/><br/>
                                Fast forward to today. I am now 39 years old and have a son who is 9 that is basically my clone. He loves being outside and in the 
                                woods the way I used to when I was younger and is always looking for things to get into. Well luckily for him, night vision technology 
                                is still around and manufacturers have brought prices down on their products. This past Christmas, my parents got him a night vision 
                                monocular as a gift. I helped them research different types and we found one that works great that didn't break the bank. You should 
                                have seen the excitement in his eyes when he opened his gift on Christmas Eve. To be honest though, I think I may have been more excited 
                                than him. We immediately opened it up and took it to my parents back yard and began to see how it worked. It was everything that could 
                                have been expected and more. You could see wheelbarrows and shovels two backyards down and it was a dark night with clouds in the sky. 
                                To really put the night vision to the test that night, I called the family outside and had my son hide in the pitch black corner of the 
                                garage. The infrared technology the night vision monocular uses was able to easily show my son hiding in the corner. Being super excited 
                                about how good the night vision worked, plus benefitting from an unusually warm Ohio December, we made plans to go to the woods and see 
                                what we could find.
                                <br/><br/>
                                We made two trips out the first week after Christmas with my sister who is a huge Bigfoot enthusiast in hopes to see animals at night 
                                and maybe even catch a glimpse of the big guy. We took both trips to Dillon Dam State Park in Muskingum County, Ohio. It is a huge state 
                                park with around 2,285 acres of public land. The first trip we took, the woods were pretty inactive, but we still had a blast using the 
                                night vision. We would take turns going behind bushes or seeing how far we could go and still see each other. On the way home we decided 
                                to take the back way home to try and see some deer in the fields along the roads. As we were driving, we would just stop on the road, 
                                turn on the night vision and look from the car window. We actually saw quite a few deer and were able to make some videos of them using 
                                the monocular.
                                <br/><br/>
                                Our second trip out was a little more interesting. Not only did my son capture a field mouse on video, but there were a lot of noises 
                                in the woods we could investigate. My son capturing the field mouse was no small task. While he was looking at the screen and scanning 
                                the woods, he saw the mouse, was thinking quickly enough to start the video record option and record the mouse running along a branch and then 
                                disappearing out of sight and then you can see the eyes reappear on screen.  Unfortunately, the noises we heard never turned int seeing 
                                any wildlife or Bigfoot, but it was still fun searching for what we heard. At one point when my sister was scanning a field and I was 
                                looking over her shoulder, I thought I saw something big standing on two legs. After I about had a panic attack, we rescanned the field, 
                                and there was nothing there. Another funny part of the night was when we were deep in the woods and we heard a loud crash. My sister and 
                                son were too nervous to look, so they handed me the night vision to see what it was. I turned the infrared up so I could get the best 
                                view, but again nothing was there. I kind of had to tease my sister a little after this. I told her that if I would have seen Bigfoot 
                                when I looked, she would have been miserable forever since she is the one who is obsessed. Especially if I couldn't have gotten a video 
                                for her to see.
                                <br/><br/>
                                My sons night vision monocular is pretty amazing. After reading the instructions a little better, we found that the 
                                night vision monocular will take still images as well as videos. It stores them on an included 32 GB Micro SD card. Then later you can 
                                connect the device to your computer with the cord that comes with it and view what you have saved. From there you can either save it 
                                off or delete it. There is also a playback mode on the device where you can see what you have saved on its LCD screen. I would highly 
                                recommend the night vision my son has as an affordable fun way to enjoy seeing what is out at night, even in 100% darkness. 
                                <br/><br/>
