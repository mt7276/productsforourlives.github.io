                        <h5>Brief History - Night Vision</h5>
                        Night vision technology has been in existence for nearly 100 years. First introduced by the German company AEG in the 1930's, 
                        and used on German tanks in WWII. At this same time the United States was developing their own night vision which used infrared 
                        light to help the military's snipers. The early night vision devices are considered Generation 0. In the 1960's, the US Army came 
                        up with and patented night vision device that would amplify light around 1000 times. These bulky devices developed are considered 
                        Generation 1 night vision and were used in the Vietnam War. By the 1970's, Second Generation night vision was being developed. 
                        This newer generation of night vision had much better light amplification, closer to 20,000 times. It was also able to work better 
                        without moonlight, plus the image resolution was greater. The Second Generation of night vision lasted for a decade or so, but then 
                        in the late 1980's, Third Generation night vision was created. The Third Generation saw even greater image resolution, as well as 
                        better light amplification which increased to between 30,000 and 50,000 times.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>How It Works</h5>
                        Night vision devices work by taking visible light and amplifying it so that you can see. They use either natural light from the sky
                        or are equiped with IR illuminators to provide the light needed. Most night vision display as a green glowing image and are good for 
                        identification. Night vision devices are very sensitive to light and can malfunction if used in highly lit areas. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Brief History - Thermal</h5>
                        Much like night vision, thermal image technology has been around for alomost 100 years. Thermal image devices use infrared radiation
                        to generate the images that you see in the lens. The first motion camera using thermal imaging, was built by Kalman Tihanyl, a Hungarian
                        Physicist. The camera was initially used for anti-aircraft efforts by the British army. Quickly seeing the value in thermal imaging devices, 
                        military all over began utilizing the technology. As the cameras improved, it didnt't take long for them to be used by first responders. 
                        Firefighters would use thermal imaging cameras to find people stuck in a burning bulding full of smoke. Law enforcement would use thermal technology 
                        to help find suspects and fugitives trying to evade capture.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>How It Works</h5>
                        Thermal imaging devices work by detecting thermal radiation. The higher the temperature of an object, the more radiation it gives off.
                        Devices using thermal technology take these differences in heat, use various colors to represent it and create an image which is displayed for the user.
                        The fact that thermal imaging uses radiation, means that they will work even without any light. Thermal devices can also create images through smoke, fog 
                        and vegetation. These devices are best used for detecting heat and not so much for identification.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the technology and production improved of night vision and thermal imaging technologies, the devices became better and prices got lower.
                        Though still used by the military, law enforcement and firefighters, these devices began to become commercially available and bought by the public. 
                        Now used for night time adventures, hunting, surveillance and more, night vision and thermal imaging technology is being used by people all over 
                        the world.
