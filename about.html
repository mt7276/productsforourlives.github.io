      <h3>Michael Taft – Creator, Owner & Curator of the Gear My Son and I Actually Use</h3>
      <p>
        Every category on this site starts with something my son and I are actually doing—hunting, 
        fishing, hiking, playing sports, or tinkering at home—and the gear we’d trust for those days.
        Products For Our Lives started the same way a lot of good gear stories do:
        a dad and his kid heading outside. I’ve been an avid outdoorsman my whole
        life, and most of my favorite memories are taking my son fishing, hunting,
        hiking, and exploring new trails. Over the years we’ve burned through a lot
        of GPS units, radios, optics, and backyard sports gear—some excellent,
        some… not so much.
      </p>

      <p>
        I originally built this site just to share what actually works for us in
        the field—what my son and I trust when we’re miles from the truck, on the
        lake before sunrise, or timing pitches in the backyard. The goal was simple:
        honest evaluations from real use, not marketing copy.
      </p>

      <p>
        What started as a father-and-son gear log slowly turned into a full-fledged
        review site with structured testing and comparison. Now we treat each guide
        like a serious project: we look at specs, long-term owner feedback, and our
        own hands-on experience before a product earns a spot on the list. Not only
        does it help people pick the right gear, it gives us a built-in excuse to
        get outside together.

          <h3>Danny Scott – Outdoor Product Reviewer</h3>
          <p>
            I’m one of the main voices behind Products For Our Lives and the one obsessing
            over handheld GPS units, walkie talkies, radar guns and all things outdoor tech.
            I lean on decades of being outside—chasing trout, glassing
            for game, coaching kids’ sports, and getting turned around on more than
            a few trails—to sort out which products are worth your money.
          </p>
          <p>
            My promise is straightforward: I write about gear the way I’d explain it
            to a friend around a campfire—clear trade-offs, no magic fixes, and no
            pay-for-placement.

        Together, we turn field time, owner feedback, and verified specs into
        practical shortlists so you can spend less time parsing marketing claims
        and more time doing what matters—getting outside, playing sports with your
        kids, or just enjoying your hobbies with gear that doesn’t let you down.

      <h2>How We Build Our Reviews</h2>
      <p>We do not accept pay-for-placement. Every guide is assembled from field feedback, user reports, spec verification, and comparisons across competing products.</p>

        <li>📋 We summarize pros/cons and use cases so you can match the right tool to your trip or task.</li>
        <li>🚫 No “guaranteed #1” claims—just clear reasoning on why something belongs in the list.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="disclosure"><strong>Important:</strong> We present insights and curated findings; we do not claim to personally perform every field test mentioned.</p>
