                        Sports Radar Guns
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        The basic technology behind the radar gun is that it sends radio waves to a target, the waves bounce off of the target and return to the gun. 
                        The gun does calculations on the frequency changes of these radio waves and displays the speed that the target is moving.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The radar gun was invented in Norwalk, CT during World War II by Ben Midlock and John L. Barker Sr. They developed the radar gun for the military 
                        in order to help solve an issue with landing gear receiving damage when a plane would land. After this effort proved successful and the radar 
                        speed gun showed it's worth, law enforcement began to use them in the late 1940's. State police in Connecticut first used the radar gun to monitor 
                        the speed of drivers which quickly turned into them writing tickets based off of the radar gun's speed read out.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It wasn't until sometime in the late 1970's, early 1980's that the radar gun began to be used to measure pitch speed in baseball.  The idea to use 
                        radar guns in baseball came in 1973 when the Michigan State baseball coach saw them being used by the police on campus. The coach, Danny Litwhiler 
                        asked if he could use one of the radar guns at his practice to measure how fast his pitchers were throwing and the rest is history.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today radar guns are used for much more than just measuring pitch speed. Baseball and softball coaches, scouts and parents use radar guns to measure 
                        the throwing speed of non-pitching positions, exit speed of the ball off the bat and running speed, as well as pitch speed. The speeds taken are 
                        used to track  player development as well as to help scouts decide if a player is truly worth recruiting. Radar guns are even being used heavily in 
                        tennis now to give the velocity of the ball being hit off of the racket. They can make going out back in the yard and practicing with your child more 
                        enjoyable. It is fun for kids, well anyone, to be able to see how hard they can throw or hit a ball.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Baseball radar guns and softball radar guns or those used in tennis are essentially the same product just called a different name based on the sport. 
                        A majority of them used outside of stadiums and ballparks are the handheld version. The handheld radar gun is light, easily  transported and incredibly 
                        accurate. They can range in price from around $100 up into the thousands. As with any product, the more money that you spend on a radar gun, the more 
                        bells and whistles it comes with. No matter the cost, they can all give accurate speed readings usually with 1 MPH..
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Three of the more popular brands of radar guns currently on the market are Bushnell, Pocket Radar and Stalker. They vary in price but I have used a radar gun from 
                        each company and all offer a great product.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Bushnell Velocity Speed Gun is the one that I personally own and have used numerous times in the yard or at the park to track baseball and softball 
                        speeds. It is very simple to use, just aim and pull the trigger. The gun can track ball speeds from 10 - 110 MPH at ranges up to 90 feet as well as get 
                        running speeds of players. It displays the speed on an LCD screen and will show either MPH or KM/H. Click 
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002X7V1Q/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0002X7V1Q&linkCode=as2&tag=tt7276-20&linkId=87437620f5fe9b5d33ce33f07727c483" class="red">
                        Bushnell Velocity Speed Gun</a> to see pricing and see all it has to offer. 
                        To get exit velocity off the bat, I stand behind a net and have the batter hit towards me.

                        Ball Coach and Smart Coach are both great radar gun options offered by Pocket Radar. Both of these models will measure speeds of 25 - 130 MPH at ranges up 
                        to 120 feet, with the speed displayed on the LCD screen. Either of the two will also display in MPH or KM/H. These radar guns are very small in size and 
                        can fit in the palm of your hand, making it easy to be discreet when you want to get readings without being noticed or adding pressure to the player. They 
                        both have the feature of storing up to 25 speeds internally, the Smart Coach can store unlimited with the App. I have used the Ball Coach model at the indoor
                        facility my kids train at quite a few times and have zero complaints and it is the cheaper of the two models. The Smart Coach option can be used standalone 
                        or it can be connected to your iOS or Android device which open up a lot of cool features. You can get the prices and see each of these radar guns have to

                        Stalker offers radar guns in two main categories, Sport and Pro, with 2 products in each. The Sport has a 300 foot range and can capture speeds from 5 - 150 
                        MPH and the Pro has a 500 foot range. They offer and LCD readout which shows the speeds in either MPH or KM/H. The models all offer simultaneous captures of 
                        the release and pitch speed of pitches. The Pro models will even capture the spin rate of the pitch. I used the Stalker Sport 2 Scout model one night at our 
                        practice last year just for capturing pitch speed, but didn't get into many more of the features. You can check out these great, top of the line radar guns, get their
