          With the hectic lives we all live, it is important to take time to bond with those we care about. We all know how great it is 
          to unplug and unwind. Sometimes though, when you want to unplug from the world, adding a little tech to the equation can really 
          enhance the experience. Whether it be electronic or the newest technology in the way something is made, finding the right products
          can make awesome experiences even better.<br/><br/>

          My family has always been active and adventurous. We are always looking for new ways to make memories and enjoy life to the fullest.
          This site is intended to let you in on some of those experiences, share the products we use to help live every moment to the fullest
          and also those that allow us to coexist without driving each other nuts. From the gear we get for camping to what we us to track our 
          childrens progress in sports, you are almost certain to find something here you can relate to.

          <h2>Night Vision</h2>
          <h5>First week with night vision, January 22, 2022</h5>
          <p>This past Christmas 2021, my 9 year old son got a night vision
            monocular from my parents as a Christmas gift. Since he has gotten it,
            we have gone out multiple nights at the local state park hoping to see
            wildlife or even Bigfoot. Unfortunately we have yet to see Bigfoot,
            but we have had the pleasure to see other animals. We have spotted
            quite a few deer, a field mouse and tried hiding ourselves to see if
            it worked. My son's night vison has video record functionality and he
            was actually able to capture the field mouse on video. You can see the
            mouse run, go behind a log and then its eyes reappear. In my opinion,
            night vision is great to have as not only a way to see what is out
            after dark, but also will help you create great memories along the
            way. The above images are from images of my sons night vision. 
            To see the best sellers from Amazon check out the 
            <a href="nightVision.html" class="navlink">night vision</a> page. To view 
            all of the great night vision products Amazon has to offer click
