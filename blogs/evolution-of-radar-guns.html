      <h2>Baseball Radar Gun Timeline (Cheat Sheet)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1940s:</strong> Doppler radar developed for military; early civilian speed guns follow.</li>
        <li><strong>1950s–60s:</strong> Police radar guns adapted for baseball experiments.</li>
        <li><strong>1975:</strong> <strong>JUGS Gun</strong> launches — first purpose-built baseball radar gun.</li>
        <li><strong>Late 1970s:</strong> MLB clubs adopt radar guns widely.</li>
        <li><strong>1980s–1990s:</strong> Velocity becomes a core scouting data point.</li>
        <li><strong>2000s:</strong> <strong>Stalker</strong> guns become pro standard; full flight tracking.</li>
        <li><strong>Today:</strong> Radar + high-speed cameras + systems like TrackMan/Hawk-Eye for spin/movement.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Early Days: Baseball Without Speed Tracking</h2>
      <p>Before radar guns entered the game, baseball coaches and scouts relied completely on the <strong>eye test</strong> and box-score performance. A pitcher was labeled “hard-throwing” based on reputation, not an actual miles-per-hour reading. There was no accurate way to quantify pitch velocity.</p>

      <p>In the early 20th century, a few creative experiments tried to measure pitch speed. In 1912, one test compared a thrown baseball to a <strong>motorcycle traveling at a known speed</strong>. In the 1930s, Dr. Harold Edgerton used early high-speed photography to estimate ball velocity. These methods were fascinating, but they were too complex and impractical for everyday baseball use.</p>

      <h2>When Were Radar Guns Invented?</h2>
      <p>The first radar-based speed measurement systems were invented in the <strong>1940s</strong> for military purposes during World War II. These devices used the <strong>Doppler effect</strong> to calculate the speed of moving objects such as planes. Shortly after, radar technology moved into civilian life and law enforcement, where radar guns were used to measure vehicle speeds on highways.</p>

      <h2>When Were Radar Guns First Used in Baseball?</h2>
      <p>Radar guns started appearing around baseball in the <strong>1950s and 1960s</strong> when coaches and engineers realized that the same devices used for cars could measure pitch speed. These early attempts worked, but the equipment was bulky and not built specifically for sports.</p>

      <p>The true breakthrough for baseball came in <strong>1975</strong> with the release of the first purpose-built baseball radar gun: the <strong>JUGS Gun</strong>. Created by JUGS Sports, this handheld device was accurate, portable, and instantly useful for tracking pitch velocity during games and bullpen sessions.</p>

      <h2>When Was the Radar Gun Invented for Baseball?</h2>
      <p>While general radar guns existed earlier, the <strong>radar gun invented for baseball</strong> is widely associated with the <strong>JUGS Gun in 1975</strong>. It was the first widely adopted radar gun specifically marketed and engineered for measuring baseball pitch speeds, and it quickly became standard equipment for coaches, scouts, and training facilities.</p>

      <h2>When Did MLB Start Using Radar Guns?</h2>
      <p>Major League Baseball began consistently using radar guns in the <strong>late 1970s</strong>. By the <strong>1980s</strong>, nearly every MLB team relied on radar guns for scouting and player development. Pitch velocity readings soon appeared on stadium scoreboards and television broadcasts, and fans became familiar with how hard their favorite pitchers were throwing.</p>

      <h2>The Rise of Radar Guns in Scouting and Player Development (1980s–1990s)</h2>
      <p>Once radar guns became standard throughout MLB, they quickly transformed how pitchers were evaluated. Organizations invested heavily in radar technology and began tracking pitch speeds at every level, from high school showcases to Triple-A.</p>

      <ul>
          <li><strong>Improved Accuracy</strong> – Newer radar guns delivered consistent, reliable readings from pitch to pitch.</li>
          <li><strong>Greater Portability</strong> – Devices became smaller and lighter, making it easy for scouts to travel with them.</li>
          <li><strong>Data-Driven Decisions</strong> – Velocity became a core data point in scouting reports, draft decisions, and prospect rankings.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Technological Boom: 2000s to Today</h2>
      <p>In the early 2000s, <strong>Stalker Radar Guns</strong> emerged as the industry standard for professional baseball. These advanced radar guns could track velocity from the pitcher’s release point all the way to home plate, helping teams understand how much speed a pitch lost on its way to the catcher’s glove.</p>

      <p>Today, radar is just one piece of a broader tracking system. Modern baseball combines radar with high-speed cameras and sophisticated software to analyze every pitch in incredible detail.</p>

      <h2>How to Choose the Right Radar Gun (Coach/Parent Checklist)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Accuracy & range:</strong> Look for ±1 MPH accuracy and ranges that cover your sport (baseball/softball 25–130+ MPH).</li>
        <li><strong>Handheld vs. hands-free:</strong> Hands-free/tripod is great for bullpens; handheld is best for games and travel.</li>
        <li><strong>Data & video:</strong> App video overlay (Smart Coach) helps with mechanics; LCD-only (Velocity) is fine for simple reads.</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-sport modes:</strong> If you coach tennis/lacrosse/volleyball, pick a multi-sport unit.</li>
        <li><strong>Power & portability:</strong> Check battery type (AAA/AA vs. rechargeable) and whether it fits in a pocket or bag.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Placement Tips for Accurate Readings</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Line up with the ball’s flight:</strong> Behind the catcher/plate for pitching; behind hitter for exit velocity.</li>
        <li><strong>Distance matters:</strong> Follow the manufacturer’s recommended distance/angle; too close or far can drop reads.</li>
        <li><strong>Hands-free setups:</strong> Tripod behind net/plate for consistent angles during bullpens.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid obstructions:</strong> Netting/backstops can interfere; clear line-of-sight is best.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How Radar Guns Changed Baseball Strategy</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>⚾ <strong>Velocity Emphasis</strong> – Pitchers throwing <strong>95+ mph</strong> are now considered high-upside arms, and velocity plays a major role in scouting reports.</li>
          <li>📊 <strong>Injury Prevention & Workload Management</strong> – Sudden drops in velocity often signal fatigue or mechanical issues, allowing coaches to step in before injuries occur.</li>
          <li>🏆 <strong>Scouting & Recruitment</strong> – High school and college pitchers who reach elite velocities gain more attention from MLB scouts and college recruiters.</li>
          <li>🎥 <strong>Fan Engagement</strong> – With pitch velocity displayed on every MLB broadcast, fans now track mph numbers just like they follow home runs and strikeouts.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Future of Baseball Radar Technology</h2>
      <p>Radar guns will continue to evolve as technology advances. The next generation of baseball radar technology may include:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Wearable radar sensors</strong> that track velocity and arm speed during bullpen sessions.</li>
          <li><strong>AI-powered scouting tools</strong> that combine radar data with biomechanics to predict injury risk and long-term potential.</li>
          <li><strong>Augmented reality overlays</strong> that display live pitch velocity and movement in smart glasses or mobile apps during games.</li>
      </ul>
