        <h2>Reliving the Moment: His First Gaming PC</h2>
        <p>Two years ago, when my son turned 10, we decided to surprise him with something unforgettable—a gaming PC. From the moment he peeled back the wrapping paper and saw that sleek tower box, his reaction was pure joy. "No way!" he gasped. And in that moment, our home gained a new gamer, creator, and digital adventurer.</p>

        <h2>Why Mouse and Keyboard Changed Everything</h2>
        <p>Having only used a tablet or console before, the switch to mouse and keyboard was eye-opening for him. Within hours of setup, Fortnite was downloaded and he proudly declared, "Mouse and keyboard is just better." And honestly, his skills showed it. Rapid builds, fast reflexes, and intuitive keybinds quickly became his norm.</p>

        <h2>Fortnite, Minecraft, and a VR Twist</h2>
        <p>From intense Fortnite matches to peaceful Minecraft exploration, he dove into gaming headfirst. What amazed me most was when he connected his VR headset to the PC and entered Minecraft. Watching him flinch at creepers or reach out to touch virtual blocks was both hilarious and heartwarming.</p>

        <h2>Learning to Code in Roblox Studio</h2>
        <p>The biggest surprise was what came next—he began teaching himself to code. Inspired by his favorite Roblox games, he opened Roblox Studio and started building. Now, at 12, he’s writing Lua scripts, designing obby levels, and debugging with a level of focus that amazes me.</p>

        <h2>Growth Beyond Gaming</h2>
        <p>This gaming PC didn’t just bring entertainment. It taught him responsibility, time management, and perseverance. We now talk about game mechanics, computer specs, and even career dreams. It’s opened doors I never imagined from a birthday gift.</p>

        <h2>FAQs About Kids and Gaming PCs</h2>
        <h3>What age is best to get a gaming PC?</h3>
        <p>Around age 10 is a great time if your child is interested in games, coding, or technology in general. Supervision and balance are key.</p>

        <h3>Is a gaming PC better than a console for kids?</h3>
        <p>Yes—gaming PCs offer more flexibility for learning, creativity, and game development compared to consoles.</p>

        <h3>What games are best for learning and creativity?</h3>
        <p>Fortnite, Minecraft (especially in VR), and Roblox all offer opportunities for creativity, problem-solving, and even coding.</p>
