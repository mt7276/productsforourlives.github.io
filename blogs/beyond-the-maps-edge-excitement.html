        <h2><strong>How I Got Pulled Into Beyond the Map's Edge</strong></h2>
        <p>A week ago, my sister unknowingly launched me into hyper-fixated chaos. She texted me about <strong>Justin Posey</strong> and his epic treasure hunt <strong>Beyond the Map's Edge</strong>. One click later, I was hooked. The journey had begun.</p>

        <h2><strong>Obsessed: From Clue-Hunting to Community</strong></h2>
        <p>From binging treasure hunt documentaries to decoding cryptic poems and chatting in treasure forums, I’ve plunged into the hunt with full intensity. I’ve even connected with folks in Montana for some BOTG collaboration.</p>

        <h2><strong>Planning My Trip—and the Gear I’ll Need</strong></h2>
        <p>The west is calling. I’ve scoped out potential search areas, packed essentials like <strong>long-range walkie talkies</strong> and a reliable <strong>handheld GPS</strong>, and prepped for all terrains. I’ll share more field-tested gear soon.</p>

        <h2><strong>More Than Gold: What This Hunt Means to Me</strong></h2>
        <p>This is more than treasure. It's about the adventure, discovery, and time with my son. These are the stories we’ll remember forever.</p>

        <h2><strong>Hunt Updates & Trailhead Conditions – November 2025</strong></h2>
        <p>Planning a hunt? Here’s an updated snapshot of early-season conditions across the Western U.S. as winter 2025–26 starts to take shape:</p>

        <h3><strong>Sierra Nevada, California</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Early-season storms are rebuilding the high-country snowpack, with recent systems dropping several inches of new snow above roughly 6,000–6,500 ft.</li>
            <li>Snow levels have been oscillating between about 5,500 and 8,000 ft; expect mostly bare or wet ground at many lower trailheads and wintry travel higher up.</li>
            <li>High passes and basins are transitioning to full winter conditions—check current snow-survey maps and highway reports before committing to backcountry approaches.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><strong>Mount Hood National Forest, Oregon</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Barlow Pass: early-season conditions with patchy or minimal snow at the trailhead; snow coverage increases with elevation but remains shallow compared to midwinter.</li>
            <li>Bennett Pass: variable, thin snowpack—expect a mix of bare ground, ice, and wind-drifted patches rather than continuous deep snow; winter grooming is not yet consistent.</li>
            <li>White River West: mostly fall-like travel with isolated snow patches and frozen or wet surfaces; treat it as shoulder season rather than full snow travel.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><strong>Colorado Trail</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Unusually warm and dry November has left much of Colorado’s high country with only light natural snow so far; many SNOTEL sites are showing snow water equivalent well below normal for this date.</li>
            <li>Expect largely dry or intermittently snow-covered tread on lower segments, with winter conditions mainly confined to the highest passes—always verify SNOTEL and trail reports before any late-season push.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><strong>Mount Adams, Washington</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Potato Hill: early-season readings show just a few inches of snow at the SNOTEL site, with snowpack only beginning to develop.</li>
            <li>Higher, north-facing slopes on Mount Adams are accumulating more snow, and travel will trend toward full winter conditions into December; expect increasing ice and snow on approach roads and upper trails.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><strong>Wyoming</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In the Yellowstone region, early-November measurements put snowpack around three-quarters of normal, with substantial snow on high plateaus and along the Continental Divide.</li>
            <li>Trails above roughly 7,000 ft are quickly becoming fully snow-covered; lower valleys see patchy snow and ice with occasional high runoff near creeks during warm spells.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><strong>Montana</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>NRCS SNOTEL data from western Montana basins show early-season snow water equivalent near to modestly below median in many mountain areas.</li>
            <li>Trails around 6,000 ft and above are increasingly snow-covered, while lower routes alternate between bare ground, mud, and thin, icy patches—plan for slippery footing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><strong>Utah</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Uinta Mountains: developing snowpack of roughly 6–12 inches in many areas above 9,500 ft after mid-November storms, with more accumulation expected—winter travel gear and avalanche awareness are essential.</li>
            <li>Zion and Moab areas remain mostly dry and accessible, though passing systems can bring rain or light snow and create short-lived muddy, slick trail conditions on exposed rock and clay soils.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Always check the latest local forecasts, avalanche advisories, road reports, and land-management alerts before your trek, and pack for true winter travel at higher elevations.</p>
